# The Structure of Hypergraphs Arising in Cellular Mobile Communication Systems

## Introduction

This repository contains Python code designed to investigate the structure of hypergraphs arising in cellular mobile communication systems. The code, developed by Ashwin Ganesan (ashwin.ganesan@gmail.com), is intended to replicate results related to bisection search as described in the manuscript [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00515).

## Dependencies

- **Main Program**: `smallest_gamma.py`
- **Module**: `hypergraph_wireless.py`

The main program `smallest_gamma.py` imports the module `hypergraph_wireless.py` and produces output that reproduces the results of the bisection search described in the manuscript.

## System Model

The system model is defined as follows:

Given a set \( S \) of wireless stations on the Euclidean plane, a path loss exponent \( \gamma \), and a reception threshold \( \beta \), we define the hypergraph \( H = (V, E) \) generated by the wireless network \( A = \langle S, \gamma, \beta \rangle \). Here:

- **Vertex Set \( V \)**: The set \( S \) of stations.
- **Edge Set \( E \)**: The collection of all minimal forbidden subsets of \( S \). A subset \( W \) of \( S \) is forbidden if the interference (or energy) at any station in \( W \) due to transmissions by the remaining stations in \( W \) exceeds the reception threshold \( \beta \).

This system model is detailed in the manuscript [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00515).

The Python module `hypergraph_wireless.py` creates the hypergraph \( H \) for the wireless network. The edge set \( E \) is stored as a dictionary where `E[k]` contains the list of edges of size \( k \). The set of edges of size k is a subset of the k-th level set in the poset of all subsets of V.  This data structure facilitates visualization of the hypergraph's edge set: because each edge must be a *minimal* forbidden set, once an edge set is found to be forbidden, all its supersets (in the higher levels of the poset) can be removed.  Thus, this data structure facilitates visualization by removing supersets of forbidden edges once identified.

## Results

The manuscript presents Algorithm 1, which uses bisection search to determine the transition values of the path loss exponent \( \gamma \). Let \( U_k \) denote a set of \( k \) wireless stations placed uniformly on the unit circle. According to the manuscript, the smallest values of \( \gamma \) for which \( U_3 \), \( U_4 \), and \( U_5 \) are feasible are 1.262, 2.543, and 4.856, respectively. The results produced by running the program smallest_gamma.py are:

===Output===

The smallest value of the path loss exponent gamma such that
U_3 is feasible is
gamma = 1.26312255859375

The smallest value of the path loss exponent gamma such that
U_4 is feasible is
gamma = 2.54412841796875

The smallest value of the path loss exponent gamma such that
U_5 is feasible is
gamma = 4.85784912109375

===End of Output===


## Further Remarks

Previously, the path loss exponent was denoted by alpha. However, since alpha was also used to denote the independence number of a graph or hypergraph, the path loss exponent is now denoted by gamma in the latest version of the manuscript.

While the results can be confirmed without using the `hypergraph_wireless.py` module by checking the feasibility of specific uniform sets of locations on the unit circle, the code is designed to be extensible.  The module supports investigations of other sets of locations on the Euclidean plane and generates the hypergraph for arbitrary wireless networks, proving useful for various investigations.
