# hypergraphs-cellular-communication
Python code for investigating the structure of hypergraphs arising in cellular mobile communication systems. Includes tools for generating the hypergraph of a wireless network, given a set of stations on the Euclidean plane, a path loss exponent, and a reception threshold.  Reproduces results of bisection search in a recent paper.
